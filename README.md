# Mern-Todo-App
It is a Todo List created using Mern Stack

#Download the final two branches:
1) master
2) frontend

#To Start:
1) Start the front using 'npm run dev'
2) Start the backend using 'nodemon app.js'

Ignore the other branches!

#Features
1) Add Item to the Database
2) Delete Item from the Database
3) Update the status of the Item (pending or completed)
4) Category wise display showing both completed tasks, pending tasks and all tasks
5) MongoDB Atlas is used
6) Backend functionality for the user signup is added (because in the template there was an image that confused me)

#Note:
I tried unit testing using Jest, but couldn't perform it properly.
